- [x] The game is declaring game over way before it is appropriate. We need to added logging and debugging to the game that captures player movement, as well as internal game state at the start of each tetromino draw, and the game state whenever the game is declared over, for any code setting gamestate as game_over, also include a variable that is a comment on why game over was declared, really there should be only one instance where a game should be declared over, but lets log all of it. It should output as a JSON dump, include or omit any information you may deem important for diagnosing. Your output should use @utils/logging.ts and download a `gameover-{timestamp}.json` whenever you shift click the "RESTART" button on the game over screen.
- [x] Refactored the game logic to be more in line with the classic 1998 NES style of Tetris. This involved removing the `isGameOver` function, modifying the `isColliding` function to only check for collisions within the visible play area, and modifying the `resetPlayer` function to use the updated `isColliding` function to determine if the game is over. This should resolve both the premature game-over issue and the issue where pieces are locking in place outside the view area.
